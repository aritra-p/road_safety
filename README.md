 Selected Problem: Problem Statement #6
 
 Abstract: As we know, prevention is always better than cure. So, we'll be thinking on implementing ways which will reduce accidents, while also thinking of ways to reach the injured to the hospital at the earliest.

Idea: When we are in the middle of a busy street, we see many people hurrying to cross the street in spite of the signal being red or cars approaching. This, if regulated, may reduce the number of accidents by a significant margin. Strict surveillance have been to no aid till now. So, the police can think of having barriers at the crossings which will open onl when the signal is green and will be automated with the signals. Thus, with the timer as the signal turns red, the barrier will also close preventing people to cross the street until the signal allows again. Also, in wide streets, there should be a separate lane for ambulance and medical vans. That is, that lane should be kept free from others even if it not being used. This will not require the ambulances asking for way from the other vehicles.
